# Stakeify

Stakeify is a staking platform built on Polygon for prize distribution in competitive gaming environments.

Players will place their stakes into a stake pool. Depending on the percentage of the stake pool that the winner provided, the winner will receive their stake back plus the proportionate percentage from the stakes of other players.

We define two protocols for each of these staking mechanisms: live staking and prize staking. Live staking is geared towards individual lobbies. Prize staking is geared towards championships such as the Rocket League Championship Series.

## Live Staking

## Prize Staking
Using Stakeify, championship players can stake into prize pools. With prize staking, earnings are calculated by the proportion of the prize pool that the player stake.

For example,
- Alice stakes 20
- Bob stakes 80
- Alice wins

Alice provided 20% of the entire stake pool. Hence, Alice will receive their 20 stake back plus 20% of Bob's 80 stake. So Alice will receive 36 in total. Bob will receive what is left of their stake: Bob will receive 64 back.

## Why Polygon?
Polygon's high transaction speed and low fees make it ideal for fast pace applications. We need a chain backing our projects that allows us to rapidly create transactions so that users can make live stakes to match in in-game events happening in real time.
